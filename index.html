                <p>Unsealed on a porch a letter sat<br>
                Then you said I wanna leave it again<br>
                Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand<br>
                And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah<br> <br>
                On a weekend, <span class ="sad">wanna wish it all away</span>, yeah<br>
                And they called and I said that I want what I said<br>
                And then I call out again<br>
                <span class ="sad">And the reason oughta leave her calm, I know<br>
                I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag</span></p>
                <p class="chorus">Oh yeah, can you see them out on the porch?<br>
                Yeah, but they don't wave<br>
                I see them 'round the front way, yeah<br>
                And I know and I know, I don't wanna stay</p>
